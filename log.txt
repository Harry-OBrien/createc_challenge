16:50:40: Initialise repo
16:54:32: Create ROS framework
16:54:47: Add battery package in C++
16:55:03: Written publisher outline, looking up code to access power info
17:01:42: Stopping for the day

New day
11:09:15: Figuring out low level C++ code to get power info
12:11:08: Bailing on C++, creating python version
12:11:52: Downloaded a python package called Power. Reading docs
12:19:26: Got basic publisher working
12:23:57: implement rough power observer code
12:29:13: implement 'on power source change'
12:34:13: Testing messages
13:38:56: Spending WAYYY too long trying to get this power package to work
15:43:57: Finish publisher using mock data
15:44:02: Creating bag file
15:48:48: Saving work, writing docs etc.

In summary, the ROS stuff is intuitive and takes 10 minutes at most to get things set up.
Interacting with Apple hardware HOWEVER. Absolute pain.
